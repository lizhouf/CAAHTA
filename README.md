Repository for Lizhou Fan, Huizi Yu and Anne Gilliland for the analysis of #StopAsianHate related tweets on Twitter. "#StopAsianHate: Archiving and Analyzing Twitter Discourse in the Wake of the 2021 Atlanta Spa Shootings" has been accepted by ASIS&T 2021. 


## Data Collection
To document and better analyze the dimensions and problems of such online discourse, between March 17 and April 5, 2021, we scraped the Twitter API using the keyword “StopAsianHate” and archived the resulting tweets and their metadata in the Counter-anti-Asian Hate Twitter Archive (CAAHTA), which contains 5,510,824 tweets in 58 different languages. In accordance with Twitter's [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), we only publically release the tweet ID and the date on which the tweet is created. 

## How to Hydrate
Please refer to the [DocNow Hydrator Github repository](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) for instructions on how to obtain the complete information corresponding to each Tweet ID.
